# A Smartphone Prototype for Touch Interaction on the Whole Device Surface

We developed a smartphone prototype that registers capacitive touch input on the whole device surface. We provide source files for other researchers to re-build our full-touch sensing smartphone prototype that we presented in our MobileHCI 2017 Late-Breaking Work. When using our prototype for own research work, please cite our paper:
